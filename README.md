# 2024 IBM Quantum Challenge Solutions
Worked solutions for all graded components of the 2024 IBM Quantum Challenge run on Qiskit 1.0 (excludes bonus lab and initialization Lab 0.) 

### Summary
These sets of labs are intended to do over 10 days. They were designed to teach people about the updates that came out with Qiskit 1.0.
Theyhe challenge ran between the 5th of June, 2024 to the 15th. <a href="https://challenges.quantum.ibm.com/2024#lab-0">Labs Here</a> (may be outdated U were designed by IBM Quantum and tRL depending on the access date; It just contains the labs with empty cells.)

Notebooks that may be useful for running this are included here:  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-notebook-environments">Notebook Help</a>

I found out about this on the final day, and did it in 9~ hours. Hence, no bonus lab is included. However, this is all the solutions to the actual challenge.

#### Lab 3: Circuit Cutting
For Lab 3, you had the option of 4 different labs (3 of which counted for marks.) I did Circuit Knitting. Why? Because it's cool (and free access after the challenge.) Ciruit Knitting is a creative way to simplify horrifically messy and complex quantum circuits. <br>
A good addendum to the circuit knitting lab is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00016">this paper.</a>

(I do not claim to be the official solutions for IBM Quantum, this repo is only to help out curious colleagues with my approaches.)

### IMPORTANT: 
IF RUNNING THESE ON YOUR SYSTEM, DOWNLOAD THE DATASETS, SCRIPTS AND EXTRA MATERIALS (like birds.csv or utils.py) FROM <a href="https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-2024/tree/main">THESE BEAUTIFUL DEVELOPERS!.</a> They will also have Lab 0. :)

#### (Also Important!)

Have fun! <br>
If you're totally new to Qiskit I'd recommend checking out "Coding With Qiskit - 1.x" by  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrgHZt3exM_NNiNKtZlHvZi"> Qiskit </a> for set-up and theory help, as well as their documentation as you go along.
