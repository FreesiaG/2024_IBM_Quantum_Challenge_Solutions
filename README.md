### UPDATE: Official solutions are out now; These are legacy solutions for those who were curious prior to their publishing, but they may offer a different approach. :)

### IMPORTANT: 
IF RUNNING THESE ON YOUR SYSTEM, DOWNLOAD THE DATASETS, SCRIPTS AND EXTRA MATERIALS (like birds.csv or utils.py) FROM <a href="https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-2024/tree/main">THESE BEAUTIFUL DEVELOPERS!.</a> They will also have Lab 0. :) <br> <br>
If you have zero clue what you're doing (props to you,) and you're totally new to Qiskit, I'd recommend checking out "Coding With Qiskit - 1.x" by  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOFEBzvs-VvrgHZt3exM_NNiNKtZlHvZi"> Qiskit </a> for set-up and theory help, as well as their documentation as you go along. <br> <br> Feel free to contact me if you need help. :-)

# 2024 IBM Quantum Challenge Solutions
Worked solutions for all graded components of the 2024 IBM Quantum Challenge run on Qiskit 1.0 (excludes bonus lab and initialization Lab 0.) 

### Summary
These sets of labs are intended to do over 10 days. They were designed by IBM Quantum to inform and educate on the updates to the Qiskit SDK (1.0 release.)
The challenge ran between the 5th of June, 2024 to the 15th. <a href="https://challenges.quantum.ibm.com/2024#lab-0">Labs attached.</a> 

Notebooks that may be useful for running this are included here:  <a href="https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/qiskit-notebook-environments">Notebook Help</a>

I found out about this on the final day, and did it in 9~ hours. Hence, no bonus lab is included. However, this is all the solutions to the actual challenge. The bonus lab scales up to 50 qubits on a real backend - so note that time on these computers post-challenge may be harder to get.

#### Lab 3: Circuit Cutting
For Lab 3, you had the option of 4 different labs (3 of which counted for marks.) I did Circuit Knitting. Why? Because it's cool (and free after the challenge.) Ciruit Knitting is a creative way to simplify horrifically messy and complex quantum circuits. <br> <br>
It's genuinely cool, you should have a read if you're bored. A good addendum to the circuit knitting lab is <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.00016">this paper.</a>

I do not claim to be the official solutions for IBM Quantum, this repo is only to help out curious colleagues with my approaches.
